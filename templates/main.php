					<h2>Sins of the Mind</h2>
					<p>A typical American family &mdash; photographer father, two talented daughters, Michelle an accomplished commercial artist with a clear upward career path. Then she has an auto accident, and the head trauma leaves behavioral changes. The part of the brain involved in impulse control is damaged (but the lesion is not visible on the usual CAT scan, and psychological tests are not done). Michelle has no control of her sexual impulses, and changes to 'a thief, a liar, and a whore' as her eventual therapist puts it. The family is broken apart, her sister and mother leave, but the father remains convinced that the daughter he loves is in there somewhere. It is a long and harrowing road to understanding of her sex addiction, and the end is not certain, but hopeful.</p>

					<h2>The Six Wives of Henry Lefay</h2>
					<p>Henry Lefay has been married before. Depending on how you count, he's been married either five or six times. So when Henry is vacationing in Mexico and gets killed in a para-sailing accident, things get awfully complicated for all the wives involved. His daughter, Barbie, feels guilty for getting mad at him over his womanizing ways, and she feels responsible for keeping the funeral an honorable and dignified affair. But one crazy ex-wife, one hateful ex-wife, two first wives, one current wife, and one future wife all have their own plans for how Henry Lefay should be put to rest.</p>
